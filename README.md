# Emmet.SDK

As the developers of `Emmet.SDK`, our primary goal is to create a versatile and robust library that seamlessly integrates the `Emmet.Bridge` functionality into front-end applications. With `Emmet.`Bridge`, we aim to establish a reliable and efficient connection between over 60 EVM chains and more than 40 non-EVM chains.

By leveraging the power of `Emmet.SDK`, developers can effortlessly harness the capabilities of `Emmet.Bridge`, enabling seamless communication and interoperability across various blockchain networks. With support for a wide range of EVM chains, including popular networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and many others, along with compatibility with numerous non-EVM chains, our library provides developers with a comprehensive solution for building applications that interact with diverse blockchain ecosystems.

The ability to connect to multiple chains offers numerous advantages. It enables cross-chain asset transfers, facilitates interaction between decentralized applications (DApps) and different blockchain networks, promotes interoperability among various smart contract platforms, and expands the possibilities for blockchain-based solutions.

`Emmet.SDK`'s commitment to supporting an extensive number of EVM and non-EVM chains demonstrates our dedication to inclusivity and fostering interoperability within the blockchain space. By utilizing our library, developers can efficiently bridge the gap between disparate blockchain ecosystems, streamline their development efforts, and offer users enhanced connectivity and functionality across multiple networks.

As the developers behind `Emmet.SDK`, we are excited to provide a powerful library that seamlessly integrates `Emmet.Bridge` into front-end applications. By enabling connectivity between over 60 EVM chains and 40+ non-EVM chains, our library empowers developers to unlock the full potential of blockchain interoperability and build innovative solutions that leverage the strengths of different blockchain networks.
